      <h2>About Red Pandas</h2>
      <p>
        <i>From WWF's Article on Red Pandas:</i>
      </p>
      <blockquote cite="https://www.worldwildlife.org/species/red-panda">
        The red panda is slightly larger than a domestic cat with a bear-like
        body and thick russet fur. The belly and limbs are black, and there are
        white markings on the side of the head and above its small eyes. Red
        pandas are very skillful and acrobatic animals that predominantly stay
        in trees. Almost 50% of the red panda’s habitat is in the Eastern
        Himalayas. They use their long, bushy tails for balance and to cover
        themselves in winter, presumably for warmth. Primarily an herbivore, the
        name panda is said to come from the Nepali word ‘ponya,’ which means
        bamboo or plant eating animal.
