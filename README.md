# Web Design 1 Final
In this project my goal was to create a website from scratch. The site is built with HTML5 and CSS with a few jquery objects. The website is responsive and features a consistent user experience. The website is currently deployed using Netlify. Through this project I was able to learn the basics of HTML5, CSS as well as an introduction to javascript and various means of web hosting.
